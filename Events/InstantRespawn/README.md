# Instant Respawn

**Instant Respawn** allows players to respawn immediately after death, without a death screen or delay.  
This keeps gameplay fast and uninterrupted, making it ideal for PvP servers, minigames, arenas, and testing environments.

The respawn is handled server-side, giving developers full control over timing, spawn location, and additional logic during the respawn process.
